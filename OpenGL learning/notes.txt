How to implement picking ???
* Maybe use framebuffers to render the scene into first, and then after picking we can use the pixel data we saved in the texture_framebuffer to obtain the triangle that was rendered.


Transformations:
------------------
* glViewport() maps the NDC of our vertices (achieved after projection and clipping), to the screen coords.
Note that the Z value is kept for later fragment operations in the vertex shader.

* Idea: apply reverse linear transformation of a screen coordinates point when mouse picking, to obtain a point in NDC.

Picking:
------------------
* glReadBuffer(fb_reference) is used to determine from which buffer we are going to read/write from/into, in the following glReadPixel() OR glWritePixel(
